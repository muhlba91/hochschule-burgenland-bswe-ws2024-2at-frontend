This is a reference implementation of the weather application's frontend for the 2nd attempt of the "Software Management II" course at the Hochschule Burgenland in WS2024.
It solely acts as a reference, not as a complete implementation, and it is not expected by students to produce a similar implementation.

---

## API Specification

The OpenAPI specification can be found in the [backend repository](https://github.com/muhlba91/fh-burgenland-bswe-ws2024-2at-backend).

---

## Configuration

See [src/config/api.ts](./src/config/api.ts) for all available and default configuration options.
To run the frontend successfully, you need to provide the following environment variables (development/build time):

- `VITE_BACKEND_API_URL`: The URL of the backend API.
- `VITE_METAR_API_URL`: The URL of the METAR API.
- `VITE_AVWX_API_KEY`: The API key for the [Aviation Weather Rest API](https://avwx.rest/) in the format `Token avwx-api-key`. The value will be used in the `Authorization` header when calling the API.

---

## Development

The service is implemented in Node.js using the Vue and Quasar frameworks.

### Code Quality

The code quality is ensured by the following tools:

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for JavaScript linting
- [Vitest with v8 Coverage](https://vitest.dev/guide/coverage) for code coverage
- [NPM Audit](https://docs.npmjs.com/auditing-package-dependencies-for-security-vulnerabilities) for dependency security
- [Conform](https://github.com/siderolabs/conform) for commit message linting
- [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) for software bill of materials generation
- [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) for software bill of materials scanning
- [Renovate](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/renovate/) for dependency updates

### Testing

To run the tests, run the following command:

```shell
yarn test:unit:ci
yarn test:e2e:ci
```

### Linting

To run the linting checks, run the following command:

```shell
# eslint with coverage
yarn lint

# you can fix some issues automatically
yarn fix
```

### Software Bill of Materials

To generate the software bill of materials, run the following command:

```shell
yarn cyclonedx
grype sbom:.quasar/sbom.json
```

### Running

To run the service, run the following command:

```shell
yarn dev
```

### Building

To build the service, run the following command:

```shell
yarn build
```

### Commit Message

Commit messages must adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

To lint the commit messages, run the following command:

```shell
conform enforce
```

You can also use [Commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) to create commit messages:

```shell
cz commit
```

## GitHub Actions

The GitHub Actions workflows ensure that all code quality checks pass and that the code is deployable.

The release workflow creates a new release with publishing the SBOM of the release and its build provenance.

---

## Amazon Web Services Deployment

After building the application, the distribution files are located in [dist/spa](./dist/spa/).

You can find the deployment scripts in [deploy](./deploy/).

> **Note:** If deploying to the `us-east-1` region, remove the `--create-bucket-configuration` parameter as this region is the default location constraint.

```shell
# deploy to an Amazon S3 Bucket with Website Hosting
./deploy/aws-s3-website.sh <BUCKET_NAME> <AWS_REGION> <CACHE_TIME>

# deploy to an Amazon CloudFront Distribution with an Amazon S3 Bucket as the origin
./deploy/cloudfront-s3.sh <BUCKET_NAME> <AWS_REGION> <CACHE_TIME> <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>
```

## Notes

- This project served as an experiment with GitHub Copilot (Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet) creating approximately over 90% of the code, including tests and most code documentation.
- Some workflow steps are allowed to fail due to the repository being private and not having access to certain security features.
- The workflow does not store the artifacts of the release build. If necessary, you can add the `actions/upload-artifact` action to the workflow.
- Features have been added, modified, or removed to showcase specific aspects of the implementation and software management.
